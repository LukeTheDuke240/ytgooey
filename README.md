# ytgooey
YTGooey: a crappy (gooey) frontend for youtube-dl, designed to be a drop-in replacement for "4k video downloader" after they added a paywall
 - Drag and drop functionality
 - Focused on smallest footprint possible
 - Ultrafast startup and download
 - All functionality of youtube-dl, like subs, thumbnails, etc
 
Made with WXPython
